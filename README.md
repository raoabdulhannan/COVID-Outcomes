Predicting COVID Outcomes using COVID Trends &amp; Impact Survey (CTIS)

This report uses the COVID Trends & Impact Survey (CTIS), compiled by the US Department of Health, Education & Welfare (HEW) to answer two primary research questions:

1. Is there a meaningful relationship between the level of in-person schooling and any relevant COVID health outcomes?
2. Can vaccine uptake (the rate of people who choose to be vaccinated) be predicted in advance using peoplesâ€™ behavior and beliefs?

The report utilizes ordinary least squares, weighted least squares and lasso regression techniques to answer the mentioned questions.
